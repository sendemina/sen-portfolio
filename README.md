# Hi! My name is Sen Demina

## I am a fresh graduate with a degree in Media Computation and a minor in Computer Science. I am a versatile programmer and artist, experienced in multiple object-oriented programming languages, UI/UX, as well as concept art and Blender. I possess both the technical and the creative skills required to solve software engineering challenges effectively, and a mind always ready for learning, which will keep me open for ever more growth.

## PROJECTS

## I. Inlandish WIP
Complex simulation of a village, made in Unity. People choose their professions, fulfill their needs, and pass down their knowledge to the little ones, creating their own culture in the meantime.

## III. Seasons, interactive visualization. 
A multi-scene interactive visualization I coded in Processing, which includes several UI features like painting clouds, changing hues, cycling through the seasons, controlling the wind, and others. 

### In the spring, paint your own clouds:

### IV. Sencraft, game and controller. 
I coded a procedurally generated landscape that the user can traverse using a controller I custom made for this game. The controller consists of a tilt sensor and a joystick, which send their signals through Arduino, using a custom-made system of signaling, to Processing where the game is run.
