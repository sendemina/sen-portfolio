Hi! My name is Sen Demina

I am a senior bachelor student working to complete my degree in Media Computation, with a minor in Computer Science. I am a versatile programmer, experienced in multiple object-oriented programming languages, UI/UX, and game design. I possess both the technical and the creative skills required to solve software engineering challenges effectively, and a mind always ready for learning, which will keep me open for ever more growth.

PROJECTS

I. Archery Game. This is a simple 3D game of interactions I made in Unity utilizing an interwoven structure of interactions. The player has a health and stamina bar, and can target an ever approaching enemy and shoot it with an arrow from their bow. This project demonstrates my experience with Unity as well as Blender, since I modeled and rigged all the assets. https://github.com/sendemina/MTEC2120_Final

II. Seasons, interactive visualization. A multi-scene interactive visualization I coded in Processing, which includes several UI features like painting clouds, changing hues, cycling through the seasons, controlling the wind, and others. https://github.com/sendemina/Seasons

III. Sencraft, game and controller. I coded a procedurally generated landscape that the user can traverse using a controller I custom made for this game. The controller consists of a tilt sensor and a joystick, which send their signals through Arduino, using a custom-made system of signaling, to Processing where the game is run.
